## Text Vectorization Techniques using nltk,Gensim and Scikit-Learn
This repository demonstrates various text vectorization techniques including Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, N-grams, and Word2Vec (CBOW) using nltk,Gensim and Scikit-Learn. The steps outlined here show how to convert textual data into numerical vectors, which are essential for machine learning models.
